Appointment Management Application

This application is tied to a database and allows you to
add and remove customers. And for those customers you can 
make appointments for them.

How to run the program

The additional report I added was appointment by title.
There's a combo box with all the titles that the appointments
have and allows you to pick one and only show those appointments.
